    """
    Hot summer nights, mid-July
    When you and I were forever wild
    The crazy days, city lights
    The way you'd play with me like a child
    -- Young and Beautiful - Lana Del Rey""",
    """
    Pi-i-i-ink flamingos, always fascinated me
    I know what only the girls know
    Colors with lights begin to mean
    Oh, oh, I see you're going
    So-o-o-o I play my music, watch you leave
    -- Music to Watch Boys To - Lana Del Fey""",
    """
    We both know that it's not fashionable to love me
    But you don't go 'cause truly there's nobody for you but me
    We could cruise to the blues
    Wilshire Boulevard if we choose
    Or whatever you want to do
    We make the rules
    -- Honeymoon - Lana Del Fey""",
    """
    I've been watchin' you for some time
    Can't stop starin' at those ocean eyes
    Burning cities and napalm skies
    Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
    Your ocean eyes
    -- Ocean eyes - Alicia Keys""",
    """So I sing a song for the hustlers trading at the bus stop
    Single mothers waiting on a check to come
    Young teachers, student doctors
    Sons on the frontline knowing they don't get to run
    This goes out to the underdog
    Keep on keeping at what you love
    You'll find that someday soon enough
    You will rise up, rise up, yeah
    -- Underdog - Alicia Keys"""
